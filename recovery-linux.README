The script file recovery-linux.sh allows loading the Toradex Easy Installer
using a USB connection, while running GNU/Linux distro on your host computer.

To download the tezi.itb file, U-Boot will use the SDP and Fastboot protocol
to comunicate with UUU. If this doesn't work out of the box, you might have
to manually install the correct libraries.

For a Debian based distro, run the following command:

$ sudo apt install libudev1 libusb-1.0-0

To run the script:

$ ./recovery-linux.sh
